I am a political scientist focused on American politics and inequality, currently working as an Assistant Professor at the University of Oklahoma. I received my PhD in Political Science from University of California, San Diego in December 2017.

My primary research area examines how economic inequality has increased the salience of racial identity, how the housing rental market perpetuates residential segregation, and how state governments propagate racial and economic inequality through policy. I use computational methods, such as automated text analysis and machine learning, experiments, and causal inference methods for observational data to study these topics. I am broadly interested in American politics, political behavior, politics of inequality, race and ethnicity politics, voting rights, urban segregation, political communication, and computational social science.

I am dedicated to understanding the consequences of American inequality and using political science to better inform solutions.



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
